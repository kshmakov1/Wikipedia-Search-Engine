 Synopsis 
 Steve Hightower   Steve Harvey   is a 1970s  funk  legend who is now a music teacher vice principal at  Booker T  Washington  High School on  Chicago  s West Side  Budget cutbacks meant Steve also had to teach drama and art  much to his surprise  Cedric Robinson   Cedric the Entertainer   is a coach at the high school  and Steve s longtime best friend  The principal of Booker T  Washington High is Steve s former classmate  Regina Grier   Wendy Raquel Robinson   whom Steve affectionately calls  Piggy  because she was overweight in childhood  
 Steve forms a strong bond with two of his students  Romeo Santana   Merlin Santana   a stylish  self absorbed ladies  man  and the equally vacuous Stanley Kuznocki  nicknamed Bullethead   William Lee Scott     acting as their mentor  and gradually  accepts them as friends  
 In season 2  the show introduced a new character  a secretary named Lovita Jenkins   Terri J  Vaughn   a woman who is fundamentally in the good mood  but nonetheless  considerably unrefined in terms of disposition  Cedric and Lovita begin dating  and eventually marry and gave birth to a child  The show also featured a succession of young actresses who served as female foils to Romeo and Bullethead  the longest lasting of these was  Lori Beth Denberg  as the overachieving  socially inept Lydia Gutman  Rapper  The Lady of Rage  also had a recurring role as Coretta  The Ox  Cox  a physically massive  brutish teenage girl in romantic pursuit of Romeo  Coretta would call Bullethead a  broke  Brad Pitt   whenever he annoyed her  but would usually refer to Lydia as  Linda   Lisa  or  Lucy   correctly calling her  Lydia  only once  
 Steve was part of a fictional music group called  Steve Hightower and the High Tops  who would temporarily reunite to perform on occasion  The members consisted of Steve  T Bone  played by  T  K  Carter   later by  Don  D C  Curry   Pretty Tony  played by  Ronald Isley  of  the Isley Brothers   and Clyde  played by Jonathan Slocumb  Two of their signature songs  performed several times on the show  were  When the Funk Hits the Fan   and later on  Harvey s eponymous talk show   and  Break Me Off a Piece of That Funk  Though Cedric was not an original member of the group  he usually sang with them on several events  
 Minor recurring characters throughout the series included Cedric s grandmother named  Grandma Puddin   played by Cedric the Entertainer  and Regina s boyfriend  former NFL star Warrington Steele  played by  Dorien Wilson    Kenan Thompson  and  Kel Mitchell  appeared in several episodes as  Junior  and  Vincent   which  All That  cast member Lori Beth Denberg starred in   Wayne Wilderson  played Byron  a  bougie  type character who was a television producer and a member of the Onyx Club  a professional men s group that Steve and Cedric tried to join  Dwayne Adway played Jordan Maddox  a professional basketball player who was briefly married to Regina before dying during their honeymoon   Ernest Lee Thomas  made a few appearances as the Reverend who eulogized Maddox  and who married Cedric and Lovita

 Steve also made several references to his popular hot spot  The Nasty Kitty  and his favorite working girl  Bubblicious  even though the strip club is never seen  Steve s topical humor of popular culture was also another recurring gag  One example of these puns   When I see that woman  I m like  Shaq  doing  Shakespeare    I just don t know how to act  Another recurring gag on the show was despite being a one time famous musician in the universe of the show  Steve was always mistaken for being other famous musicians  For example  in an episode guest starring  Jerry Springer   he refers to him as  That Cop from the  Village People   Another episode featured singer  Teena Marie   who when Steve went to introduce himself to see if she d remember him  answers  Oh yes  Lionel  How are you  Give my best to the rest of  The Commodores    referring to her Motown labelmate  Lionel Richie   
 Occasional gags referenced Bullethead s trailer park lifestyle  and Romeo s full name  he has used his full name Romeo Miguel Jesus Pele Rojas Alejandro Santana  In one episode  he wrote all of his names on paper but not prepared his assignment  resulting in an  F  Lydia almost always displayed an obsession for her classmate  and alleged lover  Arthur Rabinowitz  whom Steve referred to as  that polite Jewish boy that does his taxes  and for her favorite entertainer   Barbra Streisand   however  she had total disdain for classmates  Heather the cheerleader  and  Jennifer the cheerleader  One other gag was that teachers would explain to a student  amongst themselves  because of a condition or appearance  Helmet Boy  for wearing a special helmet in gym class   Au Natural Girl  for having a strong body odor  and  Firestarter  for one kid who kept setting items on fire

 Since 1983  there have been numerous video games based on the films   Ian Fleming  s novels  and original scripts created by the  developer  or  publisher  of the game   Mindscape    3    Domark    4    Interplay    5   and  THQ  6   all created James Bond games  
 The video games were somewhat profitable   citation needed    in the 1980s and early 1990s  featuring a mixture of styles including  side scrolling  action and  text adventure   
 Nintendo era  1995 1998  
 The popularity of the James Bond video game series did not rise quickly until 1997 s  GoldenEye 007  by  Rare  for the  Nintendo 64    GoldenEye 007  expanded on the plot of the film  GoldenEye  and is a  first person shooter  with a  multiplayer  mode   7   The game received very positive reviews  8   and sold over eight million copies   9  
 In 1998   Nintendo  released  James Bond 007  for the  Game Boy  developed by  Saffire   The game features a story including characters from multiple James Bond films  such as  Oddjob  and  Jaws   It also incorporates gambling  minigames   such as  Baccarat  and  Blackjack   
 Electronic Arts era  1999 2005  
 Electronic Arts  took over the license from MGM Interactive when a video game based on  Tomorrow Never Dies  was in development in 1998  Taking the initial concepts for the  video game adaptation   developer  Black Ops Entertainment  handled the final form of the title and the game saw the light of day in 1999 on  PlayStation  10   and met mixed reviews from critics  albeit becoming a financial success  The following entry was to be based on  The World Is Not Enough   consisting of several versions released on multiple platforms  including one on  Nintendo 64  developed by  Eurocom    11   a version for  PlayStation  developed by Black Ops Entertainment  and  Game Boy Color  by 2n Productions  with all three meeting different results in spite of being commercially successful  Unlike the former two versions   first person shooters   the Game Boy Color version is played from a top down perspective   12  
 In 2001  EA released  Agent Under Fire  for  PlayStation 2    GameCube   and  Xbox   featuring an original storyline  13   and lacking the likeness of then Bond actor  Pierce Brosnan    14   The game added the elements of  rail  shooting and driving segments to a first person shooter  The game sold nearly 5 million copies  making it the second most successful game in the series  while only receiving mixed reviews  There are no differences between the console versions  
 In 2002   Nightfire  was released  coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the film franchise and using Brosnan s likeness for the Bond character  but not his voice   15   It was developed by  Eurocom  for the GameCube  PlayStation 2  and Xbox consoles  with a  PC  port by  Gearbox Software  and a  Mac  port by  Aspyr   The computer versions are substantially different from the console versions  featuring different missions  a modified story line  and online play  In 2003  the game also had a  Game Boy Advance  version by  JV Games   which also differs from both the console versions and PC versions  
 In 2004  EA released  Everything or Nothing   developed by EA Redwood  for the GameCube  PlayStation 2 and Xbox  Unlike the two previous installments   Everything or Nothing  is a  third person shooter  with driving missions  and it stars the voices and likenesses of  Pierce Brosnan    Judi Dench    Willem Dafoe  and  John Cleese    16   among others  It was written by the scriptwriter of  GoldenEye  and  Tomorrow Never Dies   screenwriter  Bruce Feirstein   with a plot connected to the  Roger Moore  Bond film  A View to a Kill   It was released to mostly positive reviews  A different version of  Everything or Nothing  was also developed by  Griptonite Games  for the  Game Boy Advance   
 Later that year   GoldenEye  Rogue Agent  was released on the same platforms with the exception of the Game Boy Advance version  A first person shooter loosely connected to the Bond franchise a spin off  it stars a former MI6 spy  17   known as  GoldenEye  who works for  Auric Goldfinger  against  Dr  Julius No   The game was panned for its misleading title and poor storyline  The game was released on PlayStation 2  Xbox  GameCube and Nintendo DS  EA listed  007 Racing  and  GoldenEye  Rogue Agent  as spin offs  out of their canonical order they have built  
 2005 saw the release of  From Russia with Love   based on the 1963  film of the same name   It stars  Sean Connery  as James Bond  and the other characters had the same likeness of the original cast  The game is a third person shooter in the same style as  Everything or Nothing   with expansions in the story and certain details changed  such as trading  SPECTRE  for OCTOPUS  due to  legal problems    18   The game received positive reviews  and was released on GameCube  Xbox  PS2 and PSP  
 Electronic Arts announced in 2006 a game based on then upcoming  Casino Royale    19   20   but it ended up being cancelled  because it would not be ready by the film s release in November  This fact  which would lead  MGM  to lose millions in licensing fees  along with EA s commitment to move away from movie franchise games and focus more on internal intellectual properties  led the company to abandon the Bond franchise in May 2006   21  
 Activision era  2006 2013  
 Shortly after Electronic Arts abandoned the license  in May 2006   Activision  acquired non exclusive rights to develop and publish James Bond games  which were to become exclusive in 2007   22   Activision s first game was  Quantum of Solace   which was based on the 2008  film of the same name  as well as the previous film  Casino Royale    23   It was developed by  Treyarch  for PlayStation 3  Xbox 360  Wii and PC   Eurocom  for PlayStation 2 and  Vicarious Visions  for the Nintendo DS  The game was released on 31 October 2008 and received mixed reviews  with the PlayStation 2 version receiving the best reviews   24  
 At  E3 2010    Nintendo  revealed  GoldenEye 007   a remake for the  Wii  of the 1997 game  Developed by  Eurocom   using their  Dead Space  Extraction   game engine   the game updated the story of the movie  with a script by  Bruce Feirstein  and the current Bond actor  Daniel Craig  as 007   25   It was released in November 2010 in all regions and received positive reviews from critics  Approximately a year later  an enhanced port of the game entitled  GoldenEye 007  Reloaded  was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360  The port featured HD graphics  new missions and  PlayStation Move  support on the PS3 version  
 Activision s third Bond game   Blood Stone  was released on the same day as  GoldenEye 007  in November 2010  Developed by  Bizarre Creations   the game returned to being a third person shooter  featured an original story and starred Daniel Craig  Judi Dench  26   and  Joss Stone   the latter of which also sang on the game s theme song  I ll Take it All   27   It was released for PlayStation 3  Xbox 360  PC and DS and received mixed reviews from critics  Developer Bizarre Creations was closed down by Activision in early 2011 just a few months after the game s release  
 On 19 April 2012   Activision  announced plans for a game titled  007 Legends  to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of  the James Bond film franchise    28   The game was described as a  greatest hits compilation   28   retelling six film narratives with an overarching storyline to connect them together  The missions were revealed to be based upon  Goldfinger    On Her Majesty s Secret Service    Moonraker    Licence to Kill  and  Die Another Day   On 9 November 2012  Activision added the last mission to the game  released as a downloadable content  which was based on  Skyfall   The game was released for PlayStation 3  Xbox 360  PC and  Wii U  and received mixed reviews from critics  Developer  Eurocom  shut down soon after the game s release in December 2012   29   30  
 On 4 January 2013  Activision and Steam s online stores removed online availability and pages for  Quantum of Solace    Blood Stone   and  007 Legends  without explanation or warning   31   only to confirm three days later that the James Bond game license was revoked   32   A month later  Activision themselves declared that they would be backing away from licensed games in a formal statement   33  
 Hiatus and IO Interactive era  2020 present  
 On 7 January 2014  president and co founder of  Telltale Games   Kevin Bruner had expressed an interest in making a future James Bond game if he were afforded the chance  He stated that  I m a giant James Bond fan and I m always frustrated by games that make him a mass murderer  When he was asked which license he would adapt next if money and licensing hurdles were not a factor   He s a super spy  and that s a different skillset  The films make him less of a mass murderer  and there s not much killing in the books   more spying and intrigue   34   A rumour surfaced in June 2017 that Telltale was working on a video game entitled  007 Solstice    35   However  its status proved unlikely when Telltale filed for bankruptcy and closed down in November 2018   36  
 On 21 January 2016  president of  Curve Digital  Dominic Wheatley expressed his interest alongside the company in the series  saying  I d be very happy to have a James Bond licence  We could do a cracking game around that  adding that these opportunities are overlooked by the bigger firms  since  Electronic Arts  and  Activision  have their own  IPs  and no longer want to  promote someone else s brand   37  
 In November 2020   IO Interactive  announced  Project 007   a brand new  James Bond  video game  working closely with licensors  MGM  and  Eon Productions   IO described the game as a  wholly original Bond story  where  players will step into the shoes of the world s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status in the very first Bond origin story   38   39   The game is currently in pre production with no set release window  
 Cancelled games 
 Octopussy   1983  
 Shortly after  James Bond 007  was released in 1983 by Parker Brothers  another video game was announced  titled  Octopussy   based on the film of the same name  The game was planned for release on the Atari 2600 System  Mattel Intellivision  and compatible systems  Set for release in the summer of 1983  it was cancelled for unknown reasons shortly after it was announced by Parker Brothers   40  
 GoldenEye 007   1997  2008  
 A racing version of  GoldenEye 007  was announced for the  Virtual Boy    41   The game was cancelled in 1996   42   43  
 A remastered version of the  Nintendo 64  game  GoldenEye 007  by  Rare  was scheduled for release on  Xbox 360  s  Live Arcade  on 27 February 2008  but  Microsoft   who acquired Rare and their intellectual properties in 2002  couldn t get the publishing rights from the intellectual property owners   Danjaq  LLC   resulting in the cancelation of the project  despite being nearly completed   44   It was rumored that  Nintendo   the publisher of the original title  or  Activision   who had exclusive rights to publish video games based on the James Bond franchise at the time  may have been involved in the project s cancellation  but no sources confirm the rumor  Despite this  in January 2021  a near final build of the game was leaked online from an unknown source  which lead to many players playing the ROM via emulation   45  
 Tomorrow Never Dies  The Mission Continues   1998  
 The original VHS release of  Tomorrow Never Dies  featured a brief trailer with  Desmond Llewelyn  which highlighted a game that would  start where the film ends   46   Footage shows Bond skiing  scuba diving and driving in third person and on a  first person  shooting mission   47   The game was to come out on  PlayStation  and PC in the fall of 1998 and was being made by  MGM Interactive   not  EA   EA was not involved in Bond until November of that year   48   Because MGM s motion picture division had licensed exclusive James Bond console rights to Nintendo  for  GoldenEye 007  for the Nintendo 64  MGM had to buy some of their rights back from Nintendo in order to make the game   49  
 A  Tomorrow Never Dies  game was released on 16 November 1999  distributed by EA  but with notable differences from the 1998 attempt  The game was a  third person shooter  with no scuba diving level  The story follows the plot of the film  not the continuation that had been planned  
 A level in the game sees Bond skiing down a mountain and killing a Japanese terrorist named Sotoshi Isagura  who had featured very briefly in the film  while on another stage Bond has a driving mission in Switzerland  These were not from the film and may have survived from the  continuation  story  
 The World Is Not Enough   2000  
 A game based on the 1999 film  The World Is Not Enough  film and using the  Quake III Arena  engine for the  PC  and  PlayStation 2  was cancelled in favor for  Agent Under Fire    50   Electronic Arts thought  by 2001  that too much time has passed since the release of the film  and that fans would be no longer interested in the product as talks of the succeeding film in the series   Die Another Day   were taking place   51  
 007 Racing  sequel  2001  
 A PlayStation 2 sequel to  007 Racing  was rumoured to be in development   52  
 Bond6   2005  
 EA Games began conceptual work on the game in 2003  under the working title of  Bond6   The game was originally meant to be released in 2005  set to star  Pierce Brosnan  as  James Bond   A video game adaptation of  From Russia with Love  began development when Brosnan announced that he was stepping down from the role  which ended plans for  Bond6   The opening level planned for the former was retooled for the latter  and CGI work intended for the game was reused in television commercials for  GoldenEye  Rogue Agent    53  
 Casino Royale   2006  
 A game was in development based on  the film of the same name    Daniel Craig   in character as Bond  was going to give his voice and likeness to the video game  It was set to release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms  The game was 15  developed when the project was cancelled  as Electronic Arts would not finish it by the film s release in November 2006  Later  unfinished development screenshots from the Venice level were uncovered   21   19   20   Activision s debut in the series   Quantum of Solace   combines the storylines of  Casino Royale  and  Quantum of Solace   
 Blood Stone  sequel  2011  
 In December 2010  some screenshots and a video were leaked online that depicted a new James Bond game  which shared similar gameplay to its predecessor   Blood Stone   Reportedly  the project had been in development by  Raven Software   but was postponed six months prior to the leak  at which point the game was believed to be back in development  However  the game was ultimately cancelled due to  Blood Stone s  poor sales   54  
 Skyfall   2012  
 In January 2012  it was announced that a video game based on  Skyfall  would be released by Activision   55   Ultimately  a downloadable level based on  Skyfall  was released for Activision s  007 Legends   although a full game was not released   56

 Fanmade remakes 
 Further information   GoldenEye  Source 
 With the popularity laid by  GoldenEye 007  in 1997 on the Nintendo 64  fans of the video game have made many attempts to remake or recreate the title with updated makeovers on current engines over time  But  only one project succeeded  Entitled  GoldenEye  Source   the game entered development in 2005 and officially saw its international release in 2010  five years after being in  beta mode  hosted by the  Source  engine  It is a  total conversion mod  based on the multiplayer mode from the aforementioned title  
 A different team initiated similar attempts in 2013 to port the multiplayer mode from  Nightfire   2002  to the Source engine  hoping to release it on  Steam  under the title  Nightfire  Source   The project  as of today  remains in development   61   62  
 To commemorate the video game s 25th anniversary  another project based on  GoldenEye 007  entered development in 2017 on  Unreal Engine 4   with the aim of releasing it sometime in August 2022  based on the title s  single player  campaign   63   However  in August 2020  the team received a  cease and desist  letter from  Danjaq   forbidding the remake and stripping its use of any licensed asset related to the property  including  James Bond  and related characters   64   The project was reborn as  Spies Don t Die    an original experience  inspired by 90s first person shooters   65

 Sean Connery  s James Bond is parodied in  Broforce  as a playable character  Double Bro Seven  whose name is a pun on Bond s code number  007   Just like the actual Bond  he wears a tuxedo and uses a pistol  Unlike other characters in the game  he has a variety of special skills  including a martini  needed for a trophy called   Shaken  not stirred   which is a joke on a famous Bond catchphrase

 John Viret Gooch 
 
 John Viret Gooch Born   1812 06 29   29 June 1812 Bedlington   Northumberland  England Died 8 June 1900  1900 06 08    aged   87  Known   for locomotive superintendent  of  LSWR 
 John Viret Gooch   FRSA   29 June 1812   8 June 1900  was the  locomotive superintendent  of the  London and South Western Railway  from 1841 to 1850  Born at  Bedlington   Northumberland  John Viret Gooch  brother of  Daniel Gooch   was the son of John and Anna  born Longridge   1  
 Career 
 Grand Junction Railway 
 He became the pupil of  Joseph Locke  during the construction of the  Grand Junction Railway  and he became the resident engineer after that line opened  
 Manchester and Leeds Railway 
 In 1840 he joined his older brother  Thomas Longridge Gooch  on the  Manchester and Leeds Railway   
 London and South Western Railway 
 Gooch was recommended to the LSWR by Locke and appointed locomotive superintendent on 1 January 1841  Officially Locke remained in charge of the department  
 LSWR locomotives 
 Initially locomotives were purchased from a wide range of private manufacturers such as  Edward Bury and Company  and  Nasmyth  Gaskell and Company   From Jan 1843 the LSWR s own  Nine Elms Locomotive Works  started production with the  Eagle  class singles  Gooch s designs included a number of singles and the  Bison  class 0 6 0 goods  
 Eastern Counties Railway 
 After leaving the LSWR in 1850  Gooch was appointed to the post of Locomotive Superintendent to the  Eastern Counties Railway   On appointment he was given a free hand by chairman  Edward Ladd Betts  to reduce working costs of which he would receive 2 5  of any savings made  Unfortunately there were no checks and balances in place  and nor was the move minuted  so Viret would tell the accountant what he had saved and receive his payment  The main target of his costs were the engine drivers where he would sack men and then offer them their own jobs back at a lower rate  and deduct money from their wages for late running or mechanical failure  
 Betts was succeeded as chairman by  David Waddington  in 1851  who made himself responsible for the ECR stores committee  Gooch made an agreement with the Norfolk and Eastern Counties Coal Company which was partnership of coal merchant E and A Prior David Waddington   Samuel Morton Peto  and Gooch  where they would pay him 3d  3 old UK pennies  per ton purchased  Viret would then sell some of the ECR coal on for further personal gain  
 On 12 August 178 drivers  firemen and fitters handed in their notices  sick of the injustices and financial penalties being inflicted on them and in the hope that Gooch would be forced to resign  The board backed Gooch and the 178 men were blacklisted from future railway employment with replacement staff being recruited from other railway companies   2   3  
 Gooch stayed at the ECR until 1856 when the shareholders finally worked out what was going on and both he and Waddington did not have their contracts renewed   4   At this point  he would only have been aged 44 and according to his obituary printed in the journal of the  Institution of Civil Engineers   he did little practical work during the past forty years  enjoying country life in his Berkshire home   5

 Steve also made several references to his popular hot spot  The Nasty Kitty  and his favorite working girl  Bubblicious  even though the strip club is never seen  Steve s topical humor of popular culture was also another recurring gag  One example of these puns   When I see that woman  I m like  Shaq  doing  Shakespeare    I just don t know how to act  Another recurring gag on the show was despite being a one time famous musician in the universe of the show  Steve was always mistaken for being other famous musicians  For example  in an episode guest starring  Jerry Springer   he refers to him as  That Cop from the  Village People   Another episode featured singer  Teena Marie   who when Steve went to introduce himself to see if she d remember him  answers  Oh yes  Lionel  How are you  Give my best to the rest of  The Commodores    referring to her Motown labelmate  Lionel Richie   
 Occasional gags referenced Bullethead s trailer park lifestyle  and Romeo s full name  he has used his full name Romeo Miguel Jesus Pele Rojas Alejandro Santana  In one episode  he wrote all of his names on paper but not prepared his assignment  resulting in an  F  Lydia almost always displayed an obsession for her classmate  and alleged lover  Arthur Rabinowitz  whom Steve referred to as  that polite Jewish boy that does his taxes  and for her favorite entertainer   Barbra Streisand   however  she had total disdain for classmates  Heather the cheerleader  and  Jennifer the cheerleader  One other gag was that teachers would explain to a student  amongst themselves  because of a condition or appearance  Helmet Boy  for wearing a special helmet in gym class   Au Natural Girl  for having a strong body odor  and  Firestarter  for one kid who kept setting items on fire
