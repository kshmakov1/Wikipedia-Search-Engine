 Early era (1983–1994) 
 In 1983,  Parker Brothers  released the first officially licensed  James Bond  video game,  James Bond 007 , for multiple platforms. [1]  An earlier unofficial game,  Shaken but Not Stirred , had been released in 1982. [2] 
 Since 1983, there have been numerous video games based on the films,  Ian Fleming 's novels, and original scripts created by the  developer  or  publisher  of the game.  Mindscape , [3]   Domark , [4]   Interplay , [5]  and  THQ [6]  all created James Bond games. 
 The video games were somewhat profitable [ citation needed ]  in the 1980s and early 1990s, featuring a mixture of styles including  side-scrolling  action and  text adventure . 
 Nintendo era (1995–1998) 
 The popularity of the James Bond video game series did not rise quickly until 1997's  GoldenEye 007  by  Rare  for the  Nintendo 64 .  GoldenEye 007  expanded on the plot of the film  GoldenEye  and is a  first-person shooter  with a  multiplayer  mode. [7]  The game received very positive reviews [8]  and sold over eight million copies. [9] 
 In 1998,  Nintendo  released  James Bond 007  for the  Game Boy  developed by  Saffire . The game features a story including characters from multiple James Bond films, such as  Oddjob  and  Jaws . It also incorporates gambling  minigames , such as  Baccarat  and  Blackjack . 
 Electronic Arts era (1999–2005) 
 Electronic Arts  took over the license from MGM Interactive when a video game based on  Tomorrow Never Dies  was in development in 1998. Taking the initial concepts for the  video game adaptation , developer  Black Ops Entertainment  handled the final form of the title and the game saw the light of day in 1999 on  PlayStation [10]  and met mixed reviews from critics, albeit becoming a financial success. The following entry was to be based on  The World Is Not Enough , consisting of several versions released on multiple platforms, including one on  Nintendo 64  developed by  Eurocom , [11]  a version for  PlayStation  developed by Black Ops Entertainment, and  Game Boy Color  by 2n Productions, with all three meeting different results in spite of being commercially successful. Unlike the former two versions – first-person shooters – the Game Boy Color version is played from a top-down perspective. [12] 
 In 2001, EA released  Agent Under Fire  for  PlayStation 2 ,  GameCube , and  Xbox , featuring an original storyline [13]  and lacking the likeness of then Bond actor  Pierce Brosnan . [14]  The game added the elements of "rail" shooting and driving segments to a first-person shooter. The game sold nearly 5 million copies, making it the second-most successful game in the series, while only receiving mixed reviews. There are no differences between the console versions. 
 In 2002,  Nightfire  was released, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the film franchise and using Brosnan's likeness for the Bond character, but not his voice. [15]  It was developed by  Eurocom  for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox consoles, with a  PC  port by  Gearbox Software  and a  Mac  port by  Aspyr . The computer versions are substantially different from the console versions, featuring different missions, a modified story line, and online play. In 2003, the game also had a  Game Boy Advance  version by  JV Games , which also differs from both the console versions and PC versions. 
 In 2004, EA released  Everything or Nothing , developed by EA Redwood, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Unlike the two previous installments,  Everything or Nothing  is a  third-person shooter  with driving missions, and it stars the voices and likenesses of  Pierce Brosnan ,  Judi Dench ,  Willem Dafoe  and  John Cleese , [16]  among others. It was written by the scriptwriter of  GoldenEye  and  Tomorrow Never Dies , screenwriter  Bruce Feirstein , with a plot connected to the  Roger Moore  Bond film  A View to a Kill . It was released to mostly positive reviews. A different version of  Everything or Nothing  was also developed by  Griptonite Games  for the  Game Boy Advance . 
 Later that year,  GoldenEye: Rogue Agent  was released on the same platforms with the exception of the Game Boy Advance version. A first-person shooter loosely connected to the Bond franchise a spin-off, it stars a former MI6 spy [17]  known as "GoldenEye", who works for  Auric Goldfinger  against  Dr. Julius No . The game was panned for its misleading title and poor storyline. The game was released on PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Nintendo DS. EA listed  007 Racing  and  GoldenEye: Rogue Agent  as spin-offs, out of their canonical order they have built. 
 2005 saw the release of  From Russia with Love , based on the 1963  film of the same name . It stars  Sean Connery  as James Bond, and the other characters had the same likeness of the original cast. The game is a third-person shooter in the same style as  Everything or Nothing , with expansions in the story and certain details changed (such as trading  SPECTRE  for OCTOPUS, due to  legal problems ). [18]  The game received positive reviews, and was released on GameCube, Xbox, PS2 and PSP. 
 Electronic Arts announced in 2006 a game based on then-upcoming  Casino Royale , [19] [20]  but it ended up being cancelled, because it would not be ready by the film's release in November. This fact, which would lead  MGM  to lose millions in licensing fees, along with EA's commitment to move away from movie franchise games and focus more on internal intellectual properties, led the company to abandon the Bond franchise in May 2006. [21] 
 Activision era (2006–2013) 
 Shortly after Electronic Arts abandoned the license, in May 2006,  Activision  acquired non-exclusive rights to develop and publish James Bond games, which were to become exclusive in 2007. [22]  Activision's first game was  Quantum of Solace , which was based on the 2008  film of the same name  as well as the previous film  Casino Royale . [23]  It was developed by  Treyarch  for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and PC;  Eurocom  for PlayStation 2 and  Vicarious Visions  for the Nintendo DS. The game was released on 31 October 2008 and received mixed reviews, with the PlayStation 2 version receiving the best reviews. [24] 
 At  E3 2010 ,  Nintendo  revealed  GoldenEye 007 , a remake for the  Wii  of the 1997 game. Developed by  Eurocom , using their  Dead Space: Extraction   game engine , the game updated the story of the movie, with a script by  Bruce Feirstein  and the current Bond actor  Daniel Craig  as 007. [25]  It was released in November 2010 in all regions and received positive reviews from critics. Approximately a year later, an enhanced port of the game entitled  GoldenEye 007: Reloaded  was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The port featured HD graphics, new missions and  PlayStation Move  support on the PS3 version. 
 Activision's third Bond game,  Blood Stone  was released on the same day as  GoldenEye 007  in November 2010. Developed by  Bizarre Creations , the game returned to being a third person shooter, featured an original story and starred Daniel Craig, Judi Dench [26]  and  Joss Stone , the latter of which also sang on the game's theme song "I'll Take it All". [27]  It was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC and DS and received mixed reviews from critics. Developer Bizarre Creations was closed down by Activision in early 2011 just a few months after the game's release. 
 On 19 April 2012,  Activision  announced plans for a game titled  007 Legends  to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of  the James Bond film franchise . [28]  The game was described as a "greatest hits compilation", [28]  retelling six film narratives with an overarching storyline to connect them together. The missions were revealed to be based upon  Goldfinger ,  On Her Majesty's Secret Service ,  Moonraker ,  Licence to Kill  and  Die Another Day . On 9 November 2012, Activision added the last mission to the game, released as a downloadable content, which was based on  Skyfall . The game was released for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC and  Wii U  and received mixed reviews from critics. Developer  Eurocom  shut down soon after the game's release in December 2012. [29] [30] 
 On 4 January 2013, Activision and Steam's online stores removed online availability and pages for  Quantum of Solace ,  Blood Stone , and  007 Legends  without explanation or warning, [31]  only to confirm three days later that the James Bond game license was revoked. [32]  A month later, Activision themselves declared that they would be backing away from licensed games in a formal statement. [33] 
 Hiatus and IO Interactive era (2020–present) 
 On 7 January 2014, president and co-founder of  Telltale Games , Kevin Bruner had expressed an interest in making a future James Bond game if he were afforded the chance. He stated that "I'm a giant James Bond fan and I'm always frustrated by games that make him a mass murderer." When he was asked which license he would adapt next if money and licensing hurdles were not a factor. "He's a super-spy, and that's a different skillset. The films make him less of a mass murderer, and there's not much killing in the books – more spying and intrigue." [34]  A rumour surfaced in June 2017 that Telltale was working on a video game entitled  007 Solstice . [35]  However, its status proved unlikely when Telltale filed for bankruptcy and closed down in November 2018. [36] 
 On 21 January 2016, president of  Curve Digital  Dominic Wheatley expressed his interest alongside the company in the series, saying "I'd be very happy to have a James Bond licence. We could do a cracking game around that," adding that these opportunities are overlooked by the bigger firms, since  Electronic Arts  and  Activision  have their own  IPs  and no longer want to "promote someone else's brand." [37] 
 In November 2020,  IO Interactive  announced  Project 007 , a brand new  James Bond  video game, working closely with licensors  MGM  and  Eon Productions . IO described the game as a "wholly original Bond story" where "players will step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status in the very first Bond origin story." [38] [39]  The game is currently in pre-production with no set release window. 
 Cancelled games 
 Octopussy  (1983) 
 Shortly after  James Bond 007  was released in 1983 by Parker Brothers, another video game was announced, titled  Octopussy , based on the film of the same name. The game was planned for release on the Atari 2600 System, Mattel Intellivision, and compatible systems. Set for release in the summer of 1983, it was cancelled for unknown reasons shortly after it was announced by Parker Brothers. [40] 
 GoldenEye 007  (1997; 2008) 
 A racing version of  GoldenEye 007  was announced for the  Virtual Boy . [41]  The game was cancelled in 1996. [42] [43] 
 A remastered version of the  Nintendo 64  game  GoldenEye 007  by  Rare  was scheduled for release on  Xbox 360 's  Live Arcade  on 27 February 2008, but  Microsoft  (who acquired Rare and their intellectual properties in 2002) couldn't get the publishing rights from the intellectual property owners,  Danjaq, LLC , resulting in the cancelation of the project, despite being nearly completed. [44]  It was rumored that  Nintendo  (the publisher of the original title) or  Activision  (who had exclusive rights to publish video games based on the James Bond franchise at the time) may have been involved in the project's cancellation, but no sources confirm the rumor. Despite this, in January 2021, a near-final build of the game was leaked online from an unknown source, which lead to many players playing the ROM via emulation. [45] 
 Tomorrow Never Dies: The Mission Continues  (1998) 
 The original VHS release of  Tomorrow Never Dies  featured a brief trailer with  Desmond Llewelyn  which highlighted a game that would "start where the film ends". [46]  Footage shows Bond skiing, scuba diving and driving in third person and on a  first-person  shooting mission. [47]  The game was to come out on  PlayStation  and PC in the fall of 1998 and was being made by  MGM Interactive , not  EA ; EA was not involved in Bond until November of that year. [48]  Because MGM's motion picture division had licensed exclusive James Bond console rights to Nintendo (for  GoldenEye 007  for the Nintendo 64), MGM had to buy some of their rights back from Nintendo in order to make the game. [49] 
 A  Tomorrow Never Dies  game was released on 16 November 1999, distributed by EA, but with notable differences from the 1998 attempt. The game was a  third-person shooter  with no scuba diving level. The story follows the plot of the film, not the continuation that had been planned. 
 A level in the game sees Bond skiing down a mountain and killing a Japanese terrorist named Sotoshi Isagura (who had featured very briefly in the film), while on another stage Bond has a driving mission in Switzerland. These were not from the film and may have survived from the 'continuation' story. 
 The World Is Not Enough  (2000) 
 A game based on the 1999 film  The World Is Not Enough  film and using the  Quake III Arena  engine for the  PC  and  PlayStation 2  was cancelled in favor for  Agent Under Fire . [50]  Electronic Arts thought, by 2001, that too much time has passed since the release of the film, and that fans would be no longer interested in the product as talks of the succeeding film in the series,  Die Another Day , were taking place. [51] 
 007 Racing  sequel (2001) 
 A PlayStation 2 sequel to  007 Racing  was rumoured to be in development. [52] 
 Bond6  (2005) 
 EA Games began conceptual work on the game in 2003, under the working title of  Bond6 . The game was originally meant to be released in 2005, set to star  Pierce Brosnan  as  James Bond . A video game adaptation of  From Russia with Love  began development when Brosnan announced that he was stepping down from the role, which ended plans for  Bond6 . The opening level planned for the former was retooled for the latter, and CGI work intended for the game was reused in television commercials for  GoldenEye: Rogue Agent . [53] 
 Casino Royale  (2006) 
 A game was in development based on  the film of the same name .  Daniel Craig , in character as Bond, was going to give his voice and likeness to the video game. It was set to release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. The game was 15% developed when the project was cancelled, as Electronic Arts would not finish it by the film's release in November 2006. Later, unfinished development screenshots from the Venice level were uncovered. [21] [19] [20]  Activision's debut in the series,  Quantum of Solace , combines the storylines of  Casino Royale  and  Quantum of Solace . 
 Blood Stone  sequel (2011) 
 In December 2010, some screenshots and a video were leaked online that depicted a new James Bond game, which shared similar gameplay to its predecessor,  Blood Stone . Reportedly, the project had been in development by  Raven Software , but was postponed six months prior to the leak, at which point the game was believed to be back in development. However, the game was ultimately cancelled due to  Blood Stone's  poor sales. [54] 
 Skyfall  (2012) 
 In January 2012, it was announced that a video game based on  Skyfall  would be released by Activision. [55]  Ultimately, a downloadable level based on  Skyfall  was released for Activision's  007 Legends , although a full game was not released. [56] 
 Other games 
 Mobile and smartphone games 
 Since 2002, games featuring the Bond character and the  007  trademark have been published and distributed on mobile phones. The first two are based on action sequences from  Die Another Day , one of them is titled  Hover Chase  and the other is  Ice Racer . Both were published by  Vodafone . 
 With the official reboot of the film franchise in 2006,  Sony Online Entertainment  released a side-scroll action game based on  Casino Royale  developed by  Glu Mobile , following a storyline inspired by the film. Similarly, an identical tie-in based on  Quantum of Solace  was released in 2008 by the same team. The same year, Sony Online Entertainment Los Angeles developed and published an arcade  fighting game  to coincide with the aforementioned film, entitled  Top Agent . 
 In 2014, it was reported that Glu Mobile was working on another mobile game bearing the James Bond license. [57]  A year later, its title was revealed as  World of Espionage , [58]  a  point-and-click  game retelling several previous storylines from the film series, debuting an  early access  mode in July 2015 and releasing a full version of the game in November later that year. [59]  The game, after being universally panned for its uninspired content, was removed from the online mobile stores in December 2016 and Glu Mobile pulled the plug on the title. [60] 
 Fanmade remakes 
 Further information:  GoldenEye: Source 
 With the popularity laid by  GoldenEye 007  in 1997 on the Nintendo 64, fans of the video game have made many attempts to remake or recreate the title with updated makeovers on current engines over time. But, only one project succeeded. Entitled  GoldenEye: Source , the game entered development in 2005 and officially saw its international release in 2010, five years after being in  beta mode  hosted by the  Source  engine. It is a  total conversion mod  based on the multiplayer mode from the aforementioned title. 
 A different team initiated similar attempts in 2013 to port the multiplayer mode from  Nightfire  (2002) to the Source engine, hoping to release it on  Steam  under the title  Nightfire: Source . The project, as of today, remains in development. [61] [62] 
 To commemorate the video game's 25th anniversary, another project based on  GoldenEye 007  entered development in 2017 on  Unreal Engine 4 , with the aim of releasing it sometime in August 2022, based on the title's  single-player  campaign. [63]  However, in August 2020, the team received a  cease and desist  letter from  Danjaq , forbidding the remake and stripping its use of any licensed asset related to the property, including  James Bond  and related characters. [64]  The project was reborn as  Spies Don't Die  – an original experience "inspired by 90s first-person shooters". [65] 
 Appearance in other media 
 Downloadable content featuring a pack of cars used in the James Bond films is available in  Forza Horizon 4 , officially branded and licensed by Danjaq, LLC. [66] [67] 
 Sean Connery 's James Bond is parodied in  Broforce  as a playable character, Double Bro Seven, whose name is a pun on Bond's code number  007 . Just like the actual Bond, he wears a tuxedo and uses a pistol. Unlike other characters in the game, he has a variety of special skills, including a martini, needed for a trophy called " Shaken, not stirred ", which is a joke on a famous Bond catchphrase.
